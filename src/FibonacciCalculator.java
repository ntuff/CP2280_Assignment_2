/**
 * A class that allows someone to validate and generate fibonacci numbers.
 *
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such
 * that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is:
 * <p>
 * F_0 = 0 and F_1 = 1
 * <p>
 *  And
 * <p>
 * F_N = F_N-1 + F_N-2
 * <p>
 * The beginning of the sequence is thus: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..
